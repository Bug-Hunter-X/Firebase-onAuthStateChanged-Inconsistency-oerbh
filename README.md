# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener where it may not consistently reflect changes in authentication state, particularly under conditions like network instability or rapid login/logout sequences.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the problematic behavior, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` presents a robust solution.

The problem occurs because the listener may miss state changes in those situations, leading to outdated UI rendering or incorrect data access. The solution addresses this by incorporating careful error handling and state management.
