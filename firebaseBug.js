The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not always trigger when the authentication state changes, especially in edge cases such as network interruptions or rapid authentication changes.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application, as components might not update correctly with the latest user authentication status. For example, a component relying on the user's UID might continue to display data associated with an old user even after the user has logged out or a new user has logged in.
